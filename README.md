# Peng-Robinson Equation of State

This code computes the departure functions for the Peng-Robinson equation of state. This code can compute the enthalpy, entropy, turbine work, efficiency, and integrated heat capacity at a constant pressure via numerical and analytical means, and solves for the zeroes of the molar volume using built-in scipy solvers.
